# nixos-facter-modules

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: vaporware**

A series of [NixOS modules] to be used in conjunction with [NixOS Facter].

With a similar goal to [NixOS Hardware], these modules are designed around _fine-grained_ feature detection as opposed to system models.
This is made possible by the hardware report provided by [NixOS Facter].

By default, these modules enable or disable themselves based on detected hardware.
